While Egyptian authorities largely conduct effective security oversight, terrorists may attack with little or no warning and have targeted diplomatic facilities, tourist locations, transportation hubs, markets/shopping malls, western businesses, restaurants, resorts, and local government facilities. Terrorists have conducted attacks in urban areas, including in Cairo, despite the heavy security presence. Terrorists have targeted religious sites to include mosques, churches, monasteries, and buses traveling to these locations.</p> <p>Local law prohibits protesting or demonstrating without a permit. Being near anti-government protests can draw scrutiny from Egyptian police and security forces. U.S. citizens have been detained for participating in protests and for posting content on social media perceived as critical of Egypt or its allies.</p> <p>The U.S. Embassy may have a limited ability to provide consular services to dual U.S.-Egyptian citizens, especially in the case of arrest or detention.

<summary type="html"><p><b>Reissued after periodic review with updates for Chiapas, and Durango.</b></p> <p><b>Country Summary:&nbsp;</b>Violent crime – such as homicide, kidnapping, carjacking, and robbery – is widespread and common in Mexico. The U.S. government has limited ability to provide emergency services to U.S. citizens in many areas of Mexico, as travel by U.S. government employees to certain areas is prohibited or restricted. In many states, local emergency services are limited outside the state capital or major cities.</p> <p>U.S. citizens are advised to adhere to restrictions on U.S. government employee travel. State-specific restrictions are included in the individual state advisories below. U.S. government employees may not travel between cities after dark, may not hail taxis on the street, and must rely on dispatched vehicles, including app-based services like Uber, and regulated taxi stands. U.S. government employees should avoid traveling alone, especially in remote areas. U.S. government employees may not drive from the U.S.-Mexico border to or from the interior of Mexico, except daytime travel within Baja California and between Nogales and Hermosillo on Mexican Federal Highway 15D, between Nuevo Laredo and Monterrey on Highway 85D and between Ciudad Juarez and interior cities as noted in the Chihuahua section.<br> <br> Read the&nbsp;<a

<summary type="html"><p><b>Updated to reflect the ordered departure of non-mission-employed eligible family members (EFMs) and authorized departure for mission-employed EFMs and non-essential U.S. direct hire (USDH) employees.</b></p> <p>On September 28 the Department of State ordered the departure of non-mission-employed EFMs and authorized departure for mission-employed EFMs and non-essential USDH employees due to the volatile and unpredictable security situation in Beirut. U.S. Embassy Beirut personnel are restricted from personal travel without advance permission. Additional travel restrictions may be imposed on U.S. personnel under Chief of Mission security responsibility, with little to no notice due to increased security issues or threats.</p> <p>Due to the increased volatility following airstrikes within Beirut and the volatile and unpredictable security situation throughout Lebanon, the U.S. Embassy urges U.S. citizens to depart Lebanon now while commercial options still remain available. At this time, commercial flights are available, but at reduced capacity. If the security situation worsens, commercial options to depart may become unavailable. Please check flight options at&nbsp;<a href="https://www.beirutairport.gov.lb/index.php?lang=en">Beirut–Rafic Hariri International Airport</a>. The U.S. Embassy may not be able to assist U.S. citizens who choose to remain in Lebanon.</p> <p>If you choose to remain in Lebanon, be prepared to shelter in place should the situation deteriorate further. The U.S. Embassy strongly encourages U.S. citizens in Southern Lebanon, near the borders with Syria, and/or in refugee settlements to depart those areas immediately.</p> <p>Do Not Travel to Lebanon due to&nbsp;<b>crime, terrorism, civil unrest, kidnapping, unexploded landmines, and the risk of armed conflict</b>. Some areas, especially near the borders, have increased risk. Read the entire Travel Advisory.</p> <p><b>Country Summary</b>: U.S. citizens who remain in Lebanon should be aware of the risks and review their personal security plans.</p> <p>U.S. citizens in Lebanon should be aware that consular officers from the U.S. Embassy are not always able to travel to assist them. The Department of State considers the threat to U.S. government personnel in Beirut serious enough to require them to live and work under strict security. The internal security policies of the U.S. Embassy may be adjusted at any time and without advance notice.</p> <p>Since October 8, 2023, cross-border exchanges of fire have occurred between Hizballah and Israel; in some instances, including targets well north of the border region. On September 17-18, communications devices exploded in locations throughout Lebanon, including Beirut, killing dozens and injuring thousands. On September 20, a targeted strike hit the southern suburbs of Beirut. Following Israel’s airstrikes on September 27 and 28 in Beirut’s southern suburbs, Lebanon’s security environment has become even more volatile and unpredictable.</p> <p>The Lebanese government cannot guarantee the safety of U.S. citizens against sudden outbreaks of violence and armed conflict. Family, neighborhood, or sectarian disputes can escalate quickly and can lead to gunfire or other violence with no warning.</p> <p>Terrorist groups continue plotting possible attacks in Lebanon. Terrorists may conduct attacks with little or no warning targeting tourist locations, transportation hubs, markets/shopping malls, and local government facilities.</p> <p>Local security authorities have noted a rise in violent crimes, including political violence. Multiple unsolved killings in Lebanon may have been politically motivated.</p> <p>Kidnapping, whether for ransom, political motives, or family disputes, has occurred in Lebanon. Suspects in kidnappings may have ties to terrorist or criminal organizations.</p> <p>Unexploded landmines and explosive remnants of war are a hazard along the border with Syria. Heed land mine warning signs. Do not venture off the road into areas marked off with red and white plastic tape. Avoid roadside ditches, shoulders, and unmarked trails. Never touch anything resembling unexploded munitions.</p> <p>U.S. citizens should avoid demonstrations and exercise caution if in the vicinity of any large gatherings or protests as these have the potential to turn violent quickly and with little notice. Protesters have blocked major roads, including thoroughfares between downtown Beirut and the area where the U.S. Embassy is located, and between Beirut and Beirut Rafic Hariri International Airport.</p> <p>Read the&nbsp;<a href="https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/International-Travel-Country-Information-Pages/Lebanon.html">country information page</a>&nbsp;for additional information on travel to Lebanon.</p> <p>If you decide to travel to Lebanon:</p> <ul> <li>Visit our website for information on&nbsp;<a href="https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/travelers-with-special-considerations/high-risk-travelers.html">Travel to High-Risk Areas</a>.</li> <li>Appoint one family member to serve as the point of contact with kidnappers/hostage-takers, media, U.S. and host country government agencies, and members of Congress if you are kidnapped, or taken hostage.</li> <li>Keep travel documents up to date and easily accessible.</li> <li>Do not touch unknown metal objects and avoid traveling off well-used roads, tracks, and paths due to risk of unexploded ordnance.</li> <li>Avoid demonstrations and crowds.</li> <li>Stay alert in locations frequented by Westerners.</li> <li>Monitor local media for breaking events and adjust your plans based on new information.</li> <li>Enroll in the&nbsp;<a href="https://step.state.gov/step/">Smart Traveler Enrollment Program</a>&nbsp;(<a href="https://step.state.gov/step/">STEP</a>) to receive Alerts and make it easier to locate you in an emergency.</li> <li>Follow the Department of State on&nbsp;<a href="https://www.facebook.com/travelgov">Facebook&nbsp;</a>and<a href="https://x.com/TravelGov?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor">&nbsp;X/Twitter</a>.</li> <li>Review the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.osac.gov/Content/Browse/Report?subContentTypes=Country%20Security%20Report">Country Security Report</a>&nbsp;for Lebanon.</li> <li>Visit the CDC page for the latest&nbsp;<a href="https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel">Travel Health Information</a>&nbsp;related to your travel.</li> <li>U.S. citizens who travel abroad should always have a contingency plan for emergency situations.

Cross-border rocket, missile, and artillery fire continues to impact southern Lebanon on a daily basis and has caused a significant number of fatalities and injuries.</p> <p><b>&nbsp;<img src="/content/dam/NEWTravelAssets/images/Picture4.png" alt=""></b></p> <p><b>Border with Syria – Level 4: Do Not Travel, Depart If You Are There</b></p> <p>The U.S. Embassy strongly urges U.S. citizens to avoid the Lebanon-Syria border and to depart if you are there. This area has seen clashes between Lebanese security forces and Syrian-based violent extremist groups. The U.S. Department of State also warns U.S. citizens of the risk of traveling on flights that fly over Syria, which include some flights to and from Beirut.</p> <p><b>Refugee Settlements – Level 4: Do Not Travel, Depart If You Are There</b></p> <p>The U.S. Embassy urges U.S. citizens to avoid travel to refugee settlements in Lebanon and depart if you are there. These settlements are prone to outbreaks of violence including shootings and explosions.</p> <p>Visit our website for <a href="https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/travelers-with-special-considerations/high-risk-travelers.html">Travel to High-Risk Areas</a>.</p> </summary>

<summary type="html"><p><b><i>Reissued September 24, 2024, to emphasize the danger to U.S. citizens living in or traveling to Venezuela.</i></b></p> <p><b>Do not travel to Venezuela due to</b>&nbsp;<b>the high risk of&nbsp;wrongful detentions</b>,&nbsp;<b>terrorism, kidnapping, the&nbsp;arbitrary enforcement of local laws, crime</b>,&nbsp;<b>civil unrest,</b>&nbsp;<b>poor health infrastructure</b>.</p> <p><b>Country Summary: </b>&nbsp;In March 2019, the U.S. Department of State withdrew all diplomatic personnel from U.S. Embassy Caracas and suspended operations. All consular services, routine and emergency, remain suspended until further notice. The U.S. government has no ability to provide emergency services to U.S. citizens in Venezuela. U.S. citizens in Venezuela who require consular assistance should leave the country as soon as safely possible and should contact a U.S. embassy or consulate in another country.</p> <p>The Department has determined there is a high risk of wrongful detention of U.S. nationals in Venezuela. Security forces have detained U.S. citizens for up to five years. The U.S. government is not generally notified of the detention of U.S. citizens in Venezuela or granted access to U.S. citizen prisoners there.</p> <p>Violent crimes, such as homicide, armed robbery, kidnapping, and carjacking, are common in Venezuela. Political rallies and demonstrations occur, often with little notice. Police and security forces have instituted a brutal crackdown on anti-Maduro demonstrations, including the use of tear gas, pepper spray, and rubber bullets against participants, and which occasionally devolve into looting and vandalism.</p> <p>Colombian terrorist groups operate in Venezuela’s border areas with Colombia, Brazil, and Guyana.</p> <p>Shortages of gasoline, electricity, water, medicine, and medical supplies continue throughout much of Venezuela.&nbsp;</p> <p>Read the <a href="https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/International-Travel-Country-Information-Pages/Venezuela.html">country information page</a> for additional information on travel to Venezuela.</p> <p>If you decide to travel to Venezuela:</p> <ul> <li><a name="_Hlk177567081" id="_Hlk177567081"></a>Avoid travel to Venezuela via any means, including via land border crossings.

A plan should include a “proof of life” protocol with loved ones so that if you are taken hostage, your loved ones will know specific questions (and answers) to ask the hostage-takers to be sure that you are alive (and to rule out a hoax).</li> <li>U.S. citizens’ contingency plans for travel to Venezuela should not rely on U.S. government assistance.</li> <li>The U.S. government cannot assist U.S. citizens in Venezuela in replacing lost or expired travel documents.</li> <li>Travelers face an increased risk using unregulated taxis from the Maiquetia “Simón Bolívar” International Airport and ATMs in the area.</li> <li>U.S. citizens in Venezuela should consider hiring a professional security organization.</li> <li>Over the counter and prescription medicines are unlikely to be available to U.S. citizens in Venezuela.</li> <li>The U.S. government will not be able to assist should the need for a medical emergency or evacuation arise.

<summary type="html"><p><b><i>Updated to reflect additional information on crime.</i></b></p> <p>Do not travel to Haiti due to <b>kidnapping</b>, <b>crime</b>, <b>civil unrest</b>, and <b>limited health care.</b></p> <p><b>Country Summary: </b>Since March 2024, Haiti has been under a State of Emergency. Crimes involving firearms are common in Haiti. They include robbery, carjackings, sexual assault, and kidnappings for ransom. Kidnapping is widespread, and U.S. citizens have been victims and have been hurt or killed. Kidnappers may plan carefully or target victims at random, unplanned times. Kidnappers will even target and attack convoys. Kidnapping cases often involve ransom requests. Victims’ families have paid thousands of dollars to rescue their family members. </p> <p>Protests, demonstrations, and roadblocks are common and unpredictable. They often damage or destroy infrastructure and can become violent. Mob killings and assaults by the public have increased, including targeting those suspected of committing crimes. &nbsp;</p> <p>The airport in Port-au-Prince can be a focal point for armed activity. Armed robberies are common. Carjackers attack private vehicles stuck in traffic. They often target lone drivers, especially women. As a result, the U.S. embassy requires its staff to use official transportation to and from the airport.</p> <p>Do not cross the border by land between Haiti and the Dominican Republic due to the threat of kidnapping and violence. These dangers are present on roads from major Haitian cities to the border. The U.S. embassy cannot help you enter the Dominican Republic by air, land, or sea.  U.S. citizens who cross into the Dominican Republic at an unofficial crossing may face high immigration fines if they try to leave. The U.S. Coast Guard has concerns about security in the ports of Haiti. Until those are addressed, the Coast Guard advises mariners and passengers traveling through the ports of Haiti to exercise caution.</p> <p>&nbsp;The U.S. government is very limited in its ability to help U.S. citizens in Haiti. Local police and other first responders often lack the resources to respond to emergencies or serious crime. Shortages of gasoline, electricity, medicine, and medical supplies are common throughout the country. Public and private medical clinics and hospitals often lack trained staff and basic resources. In addition, they require prepayment for services in cash.</p> <p>U.S. government personnel are subjected to a nightly curfew and are prohibited from walking in Port-au-Prince. Personnel movement is restricted throughout Haiti. U.S. government personnel in Haiti are also prohibited from:</p> <ul> <li>Using any kind of public transportation or taxis. </li> <li>Visiting banks and using ATMs. </li> <li>Driving at night. </li> <li>Traveling anywhere after dark. </li> <li>Traveling without prior approval and special security measures in place.</li> </ul> <p>Read the <a href="https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/International-Travel-Country-Information-Pages/Haiti.html#:~:text=Do%20Not%20Travel.-,Avoid%20all%20international%20travel%20due%20to%20the%20global%20impact%20of,robbery%20and%20carjacking%2C%20is%20common.&amp;text=Demonstrations%2C%20tire%20burning%2C%20and%20roadblocks,unpredictable%2C%20and%20can%20turn%20violent.">country information page</a> for additional information on travel to Haiti. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>If you decide to travel to Haiti: </p> <ul> <li>Avoid demonstrations and crowds. Do not attempt to drive through roadblocks. </li> <li>Arrange airport transfers and hotels in advance, or have your host meet you upon arrival. </li> <li>Do not give personal information to unauthorized people to include those without uniforms or credentials. Individuals with bad intent may frequent areas at the airport, including near immigration and customs. </li> <li>If you are being followed as you leave the airport, drive to the nearest police station immediately. </li> <li>Travel by vehicle to reduce walking in public. </li> <li>Travel in groups or at least do not travel alone. </li> <li>Always keep vehicle doors locked and windows closed when driving. </li> <li>Be cautious and alert. This is especially important when driving through markets and other crowded areas. </li> <li>Do not fight back during a robbery.

<summary type="html"><p><b><i>Reissued after periodic review with updates to reflect the security environment. </i></b></p> <p>Reconsider travel to Pakistan due to<b> terrorism</b>. Some areas have increased risk. Read the entire Travel Advisory.</p> <p>Do not travel to: </p> <ul> <li>Balochistan province and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP) province, including the former Federally Administered Tribal Areas (FATA), due to <b>terrorism.</b></li> <li>The immediate vicinity of the India-Pakistan border and the Line of Control due to <b>terrorism</b> and <b>the potential for armed</b> <b>conflict</b>.</li> </ul> <p><b>Country Summary:</b>&nbsp;Violent extremist groups continue to plot attacks in Pakistan. Terrorist attacks are frequent in Balochistan and KP, including the former FATA. Large-scale terrorist attacks have resulted in numerous casualties, and small-scale attacks are frequent. Terrorism and ongoing violence by extremist elements have led to indiscriminate attacks on civilian, as well as local military and police targets. Terrorists may attack with little or no warning, targeting transportation hubs, markets, shopping malls, military installations, airports, universities, tourist attractions, schools, hospitals, places of worship, and government facilities. Terrorists have targeted U.S. diplomats and diplomatic facilities in the past.&nbsp;</p> <p>Local law prohibits protesting or demonstrating without a permit. Being near a protest can draw scrutiny from Pakistani security forces. U.S. citizens have been detained for participating in protests and for posting content on social media perceived as critical of the Pakistani government, military, or officials. Internet and mobile phone service outages are common, especially during protests.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>Pakistan’s security environment remains fluid, sometimes changing with little or no notice. There are greater security resources and infrastructure in the major cities, particularly Islamabad, and security forces in these areas may be more readily able to respond to an emergency compared to other areas of the country.</p> <p>The government of Pakistan restricts the travel of U.S. government personnel working in Pakistan. The U.S. government has limited ability to provide services to U.S. citizens in KP, Balochistan, Pakistan-administered Azad Kashmir, and most areas outside of Islamabad, Lahore, and Karachi as U.S. government personnel must obtain special authorization to travel to those locales. The U.S. Embassy and Consulates require U.S. government personnel to use armed escorts and armored vehicles when traveling in certain parts of the country, both for official and personal travel. Additional restrictions on movements can occur suddenly and at any time, depending on local circumstances and security conditions. U.S. government personnel on assignment in Pakistan are prohibited from attending most large gatherings. &nbsp;</p> <p>The U.S. Embassy and Consulates have a limited ability to provide consular services to dual U.S.-Pakistani citizens who have been arrested or detained as Pakistani law considers such individuals to be citizens of Pakistan.</p> <p>The U.S. Consulate General in Peshawar does not provide consular services.&nbsp; Services for U.S. citizens are available from the U.S. Embassy in Islamabad, U.S. Consulate General in Karachi, and the U.S. Consulate General in Lahore.&nbsp; </p> <p>Read the <a href="https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/International-Travel-Country-Information-Pages/Pakistan.html">country information page</a> for additional information on travel to Pakistan.&nbsp;</p> <p>If you decide to travel to Pakistan:      </p> <ul> <li>Visit our website for <a href="https://travel.state.gov/content/passports/en/go/TraveltoHighRiskAreas.html">Travel to High-Risk Areas</a>. </li> <li>Monitor local media for breaking events and be prepared to adjust your plans.</li> <li>Vary your travel routes and timing. </li> <li>Remain aware of your surroundings, particularly around public markets, restaurants, police installations, places of worship, government and military institutions, and other locations.&nbsp;</li> <li>Be cognizant of local events.

The U.S. government has limited ability to assist U.S. citizens in the above locations.</p> <p>The Houthis have perpetrated<b> missile and drone attacks</b>&nbsp;in Saudi Arabia. Attacks have been rare since the announcement of a truce between Saudi Arabia, the Houthi rebels, and the internationally recognized Government of Yemen. Recent Houthi attacks have focused on vessels in Red Sea shipping lanes. The Houthis have also threatened to renew attacks against Saudi Arabia. Past attacks have been aimed at targets throughout the country. Cities, infrastructure, airports, military bases and energy facilities have all been targeted. &nbsp;</p> <p>Debris from intercepted drones and missiles has also been a risk. U.S. citizens living and working near infrastructure and military bases and infrastructure are at increased risk if attacks reoccur. The risk is most pronounced near the border with Yemen.</p> <p><b>Terrorism</b>&nbsp;continues to be a concern in Saudi Arabia. Attacks can occur with little or no warning. Terrorists have targeted Saudi and international interests. Religious sites and other places frequented by U.S. citizens have been targeted. Globally, terrorists are using less sophisticated methods of attack – including knives, firearms, and vehicles. Targets often include tourist locations, large gatherings, transportation hubs, markets, shopping malls, and government facilities. Terrorists are also known to time attacks around major holidays and/or in response to military operations.</p> <p><b>Social media activity</b>&nbsp;Saudi authorities deem critical, offensive, or disruptive to public order, could lead to&nbsp;<b>arrest</b>. U.S. citizens have been arrested for past social media activity and comments made while outside of Saudi Arabia. This may include posting, re-posting, or liking comments critical of Saudi institutions, policies, or public life. Saudi laws on cybercrime and terrorism are used to prosecute these cases. Punishment for social media activity has included prison sentences of up to 45 years. Saudi courts do not necessarily consider the timeframe of the posts, or the location from which they were made, to be material.</p> <p><b>It is illegal to bring drugs (including marijuana), drug paraphernalia, or alcohol into Saudi Arabia. Importing gambling-related items, weapons, or pork is prohibited. Bringing materials that could be considered obscene or suggestive into Saudi Arabia is also prohibited</b>.

Iranian authorities routinely delay consular access to detained U.S. nationals and consistently deny consular access to dual U.S.-Iranian nationals.</p> <p>Violent extremist groups, including U.S. government-designated terrorist organizations, operate in Iran. ISIS and affiliated groups have claimed responsibility for bombings and other attacks in Iran. The threat of terrorist activity persists, as does the risk of death or injury to bystanders.</p> <p>The U.S. government does not have diplomatic or consular relations with the Islamic Republic of Iran. The U.S. government is unable to provide routine or emergency consular services to U.S. citizens in Iran.</p> <p>Companies offering surrogacy services in Iran are misrepresenting the security situation in Iran and the risks of the unregulated surrogacy tourism industry. Private companies that arrange such visits and services put U.S. citizens in danger.</p> <p>Due to the risks of operating civilian aircraft within or in the vicinity of Iran, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has issued a Notice to Air Missions (NOTAM) and/or a Special Federal Aviation Regulation (SFAR). For more information U.S. citizens should consult the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.faa.gov/air_traffic/publications/us_restrictions/" title="faa.gov">Federal Aviation Administration’s Prohibitions, Restrictions and Notices</a>.</p> <p>Read the&nbsp;<a href="https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/International-Travel-Country-Information-Pages/Iran.html" adhocenable="false">country information page</a>&nbsp;for additional information on travel to Iran.</p> <p>If you are currently in Iran:&nbsp; &nbsp;</p> <ul> <li>Consider the risks involved in possessing dual&nbsp;<a href="https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/travelers-with-special-considerations/Dual-Nationality-Travelers.html" adhocenable="false">U.S. Iranian nationality</a>.</li> <li>Review your personal security plan and visit our website for&nbsp;<a href="https://travel.state.gov/content/passports/en/go/TraveltoHighRiskAreas.html" adhocenable="false">Travel to High-Risk Areas</a>.</li> <li>Draft a will and designate appropriate insurance beneficiaries and/or power of attorney.</li> <li>Discuss a plan with loved ones regarding care/custody of children, pets, property, belongings, non-liquid assets (collections, artwork, etc.), funeral wishes, etc.</li> <li>Establish your own personal security plan in coordination with your employer or host organization or consider consulting with a professional security organization.</li> <li>Leave DNA samples with your medical provider.</li> <li>Have a plan for departing Iran that does not rely on U.S. government assistance.</li> <li>Enroll in the&nbsp;<a href="https://step.state.gov/" adhocenable="false">Smart Traveler Enrollment Program (STEP)</a>&nbsp;to receive Alerts and make it easier to locate you in an emergency.</li> <li>Follow the Department of State on&nbsp;<a href="https://www.facebook.com/travelgov/" title="facebook" adhocenable="false">Facebook</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a title="Twitter/X" adhocenable="false" href="https://twitter.com/TravelGov">Twitter/X</a>.</li> <li>Visit the CDC page for the latest&nbsp;<a href="https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/destinations/list" adhocenable="false">Travel Health Information</a>&nbsp;related to your travel.</li> <li>Prepare a contingency plan for emergency situations.

<summary type="html"><p><b><i>Updated risk indicators, and the “If you decide to travel” section.</i></b></p> <p>Do not travel to Libya due to <b>crime, terrorism, unexploded landmines, civil unrest, kidnapping, </b>and<b> armed conflict.</b></p> <p><b>Country Summary</b>:&nbsp;Crime levels in Libya remain high, including the threat of kidnapping for ransom. U.S. citizens have been targets of these crimes.</p> <p><b>Terrorist groups</b> are present in Libya. No terrorist incidents that involved foreigners have been publicly reported in Libya since 2015. &nbsp;Nevertheless, terrorist attacks could occur with little or no warning, targeting public spaces like tourist locations, hotels, transportation hubs, markets/shopping malls, and government facilities.</p> <p><b>Kidnapping</b> is widespread, and victims have included U.S. citizens. Kidnappers may take advantage of unplanned opportunities. Criminal or armed individuals or groups have threatened to and/or have seized or detained and threatened to kill, injure, or continue to detain individuals in order to compel a third party (including a governmental organization) to do or abstain from doing something as a condition of release.</p> <p><b>Unexploded landmines, </b>cluster munitions, and unexploded ammunition are a hazard throughout Libya. Heed land mine warning signs. Do not venture off the road into areas marked with red and white plastic tape. Avoid roadside ditches, shoulders, and unmarked trails. Never touch anything resembling unexploded munitions. Landmines do exist in populated areas due to numerous ground offensives in the last decade.</p> <p>Outbreaks of violence between competing armed groups can occur with little warning and have the potential to impact U.S. citizens. The capital, Tripoli, and other cities, such as Surman, Al-Jufra, Misrata, Ajdabiya, Benghazi, and Zuwara, have witnessed fighting among armed groups. Hotels and airports frequented by U.S. citizens have been the targets of these attacks. Even demonstrations intended to be peaceful can turn confrontational and escalate into violence.</p> <p>Armed groups sometimes detain travelers for arbitrary reasons, do not grant detainees access to a lawyer or a legal process, and do not allow detainees to inform others of their status. U.S. citizens should carry proof of citizenship and valid immigration status at all times, but having these documents does not guarantee fair treatment.</p> <p>&nbsp;While there are operational international airports in Libya with regular domestic and international flights, flights are often delayed, rerouted, and cancelled without warning.&nbsp; The U.S. government prohibits U.S. commercial aviation operations within Libyan airspace.</p> <p>Due to risks to civil aviation operating within or in the vicinity of Libya, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has issued a Notice to Air Missions (NOTAM) and/or a Special Federal Aviation Regulation (SFAR). For more information U.S. citizens should consult the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.faa.gov/air_traffic/publications/us_restrictions/">Federal Aviation Administration’s Prohibitions, Restrictions and Notices</a>.</p> <p>The Commandant of the U.S. Coast Guard has determined that effective anti-terrorism measures are not in place in Libyan ports and has imposed conditions of entry on vessels that arrive in U.S. ports having visited ports in Libya. Mariners and passengers traveling through the ports of Libya should exercise caution.</p> <p>The U.S. government has limited ability to provide emergency or routine assistance to U.S. citizens in Libya, as the U.S. Embassy in Tripoli suspended its operations in July 2014.</p> <p>U.S. citizens in Libya in need of routine consular services should contact the U.S. Embassy in Tunis, Tunisia for assistance. To contact the U.S. Embassy in Tunis, <a adhocenable="false" href="https://tn.usembassy.gov/u-s-citizen-services/">click here</a>.</p> <p>U.S. citizens who are in Libya are urged to depart as soon as possible via commercial means if possible. U.S. citizens who are seeking U.S. government assistance to depart should email complete biographic details and contact information (email and phone number), as well as U.S. passport number, to <a adhocenable="false" href="mailto:TunisACS@state.gov">TunisACS@state.gov</a>.</p> <p>The Department of State will continue to provide information via the Smart Traveler Enrollment Program (STEP), Embassy Libya's web page, Travel.State.Gov, Facebook, and Twitter/X.</p> <p>Read the&nbsp;<a href="https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/International-Travel-Country-Information-Pages/Libya.html">country information page</a>&nbsp;for additional information on travel to Libya.</p> <p>If you decide to travel to Libya:</p> <ul> <li>Visit our website for&nbsp;<a href="https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/travelers-with-special-considerations/high-risk-travelers.html">Travel to High-Risk Areas</a>.</li> <li>Carry proof of citizenship and valid immigration status at all times.</li> <li>Avoid demonstrations and crowds.</li> <li>Make contingency plans to leave.</li> <li>Draft a will and designate appropriate insurance beneficiaries and/or a power of attorney.</li> <li>Discuss a plan with loved ones regarding care/custody of children, pets, property, belongings, non-liquid assets (collections, artwork, etc.), funeral wishes, etcetera.</li> <li>Establish your own personal security plan in coordination with your family, and employer or host organization, so that they can monitor your safety and location. This plan should specify whom you would contact first, and how that person should share information.</li> <li>Appoint one family member to serve as the point of contact with kidnappers/hostage-takers, media, U.S. and host country government agencies, and members of Congress if you are kidnapped, taken hostage, or detained.</li> <li>Consider consulting with a professional security organization.</li> <li>Do not touch unknown metal objects and avoid traveling off well-used roads, tracks, and paths due to risk of unexploded ordnance.</li> <li>Enroll in the&nbsp;<a href="https://step.state.gov/step/">Smart Traveler Enrollment Program</a>&nbsp;(<a href="https://step.state.gov/step/">STEP</a>) to receive Alerts and make it easier to locate you in an emergency.</li> <li>Review the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.osac.gov/Content/Browse/Report?subContentTypes=Country%20Security%20Report">Country Security Report</a>&nbsp;for Libya.</li> <li>Follow the Department of State on&nbsp;<a href="https://www.facebook.com/travelgov/">Facebook</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/TravelGov">X/Twitter</a>.</li> <li>Visit the CDC page for the latest&nbsp;<a href="https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/destinations/list">Travel Health Information</a>&nbsp;related to your travel.</li> <li>U.S. citizens who travel abroad should always have a contingency plan for emergency situations.

The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) are conducting large-scale military operations in Gaza against Hamas, a U.S. government-designated foreign terrorist organization, which was responsible for the October 7 attack on Israel. As a result of the armed conflict, the security environment within Gaza and on its borders is extremely dangerous and volatile. The pedestrian crossing between Gaza and Israel was damaged on October 7 and remains closed, and the pedestrian crossing between Egypt and Gaza has been closed since May 7 and it is unknown when it will re-open. &nbsp; There are sporadic telecommunication and internet outages within Gaza further inhibiting the ability of residents to obtain information. &nbsp;</p> <p>If a U.S. citizen, Lawful Permanent Resident (LPR), or qualified immediate family member desires our assistance and has not already provided their information to the Department of State, please email U.S. Embassy Jerusalem at <a href="mailto:JerusalemACS@state.gov">JerusalemACS@state.gov </a>with a copy of the individual’s travel document as well as an explanation or proof of relationship.</p> <p>Visit our website for <a href="https://travel.state.gov/content/passports/en/go/TraveltoHighRiskAreas.html">Travel to High Risk Areas</a>.</p> <ul> <li>If you decide to travel to Gaza:</li> <li>Be prepared for an indefinite stay as the crossings between Gaza with Israel and Egypt can close without advance notice and for long periods during times of unrest and armed conflict.</li> <li>Have a plan for entering and departing Gaza that does not rely on U.S. government assistance.</li> <li>Households with infants and young children should plan for food and supplies, such as diapers and wipes, formula or baby food, and a change of clothing.</li> <li>If you take medication, make sure to have at least five days’ worth at any given time – if you can, we encourage enough for two weeks beyond your scheduled trip and have a copy of your prescriptions handy.</li> <li>If you use assistive or medical devices that require a power supply, be sure to find backup power or other ways that will sustain your device or equipment during a power outage.</li> <li>Draft a will and designate appropriate insurance beneficiaries and/or power of attorney.</li> <li>Discuss a plan with loved ones regarding care/custody of children, pets, property, belongings, non-liquid assets (collections, artwork, etc.), funeral wishes, etc.</li> <li>Leave DNA samples with your medical provider in case it is necessary for your family to access them.</li> </ul> <p>Please be sure to visit our website for <a href="https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/crisis_and_disaster_abroad_be_ready.html">How to Prepare for a Crisis</a> for information that may be helpful.</p> <p><b>Israel – Reconsider Travel (see below for specific advice on travel within 2.5 miles of Lebanese and Syrian borders)</b></p> <p>Reconsider travel due to <b>terrorism</b> and <b>civil unrest</b>.</p> <p>The security situation remains unpredictable, and U.S. citizens are reminded to remain vigilant and take appropriate steps to increase their security awareness as security incidents, including mortar and rocket fire, often take place without warning.</p> <ul> <li>U.S. government employees in Israel under Chief of Mission security responsibility are currently restricted from personal travel to the following locations:</li> <li>Within seven miles of the Gaza demarcation line, as well as the cities of Ashdod and Ashkelon; and</li> <li>Within 1.5 miles of the Israel-Egypt border.</li> </ul> <p>Additional travel restrictions may be imposed on U.S. government employees under Chief of Mission security responsibility, with little to no notice due to increased security issues or threats.</p> <p><b>Northern Israel (within 2.5 miles of Lebanese and Syrian borders) – Do Not Travel</b></p> <p>U.S. government employees in Israel under Chief of Mission security responsibility are currently restricted from personal travel within 2.5 miles of the Lebanese and Syrian borders.

<summary type="html"><p><b><i>Reissued after periodic review with updates to reflect the security environment and immigration information.</i></b></p> <p>Do not travel to Afghanistan due to<b> terrorism, risk of wrongful detention, civil unrest, kidnapping and crime.</b></p> <p><b>Country Summary:</b>&nbsp;The U.S. Embassy in Kabul suspended operations in 2021. The U.S. government is not able to provide routine or emergency consular services to U.S. citizens in Afghanistan.</p> <p>Multiple terrorist groups are active in country and U.S. citizens are targets of kidnapping and hostage-taking. The Taliban have harassed and detained aid and humanitarian workers. The activities of foreigners may be viewed with suspicion, and reasons for detention may be unclear. Even if you are registered with the appropriate authorities to conduct business, the risk of detention is high. &nbsp;</p> <p>The Department has determined there is a risk of wrongful detention of U.S. nationals in Afghanistan. The Taliban do not regularly permit the United States to conduct welfare checks on U.S. citizens in detention, including by phone. Detention can be lengthy. While in detention, U.S. citizens have limited or no access to medical attention and may be subject to physical abuse. The Taliban may not recognize your U.S. citizenship if you are a dual Afghan-U.S. citizen or have a claim to Afghan citizenship, which further limits our ability to assist.</p> <p>Individuals should not travel to Afghanistan for any reason, including to accompany eligible family members for relocation. &nbsp;U.S. citizen or LPRs do not have to be physically present in Afghanistan for their qualifying family members to receive such assistance.

Read the entire Travel Advisory.&nbsp;</p> <p><b>Country Summary:</b> Violent crime occurs throughout Jamaica. Tourist areas generally see lower rates of violent crime than other parts of the country. The homicide rate reported by the Government of Jamaica is among the highest in the Western Hemisphere. Armed robberies and sexual assaults are common.&nbsp;</p> <p>The U.S. Embassy routinely receives reports of sexual assaults, including from U.S. citizen tourists at resorts. U.S. citizens report slow or unsatisfactory response to serious criminal incidents. When arrests are made, cases are infrequently prosecuted to a final verdict and sentence.&nbsp;</p> <p>U.S. citizens should not expect the same level of health care available in Jamaica as is available in the United States. This includes generally lower levels of emergency service response times or routine care for illness or injury. Private hospitals require payment up front before admitting patients and may not have the ability to provide specialized care. Ambulance services are not always staffed with EMTs or always readily available, especially in rural areas. U.S. citizens should bring extra prescription medication as common medications such as insulin can be difficult to obtain.</p> <p><b>We strongly encourage you to obtain traveler’s insurance, including medical evacuation insurance, before traveling.&nbsp;<u>The Department of State does not pay medical bills.</u></b></p> <p><u>U.S. Medicare/Medicaid does not apply overseas.

<summary type="html"><p><b><i>Updated with changes to security information.</i></b></p> <p><b>Do not travel to</b> Somalia due to <b>crime</b>, <b>terrorism</b>,<b> civil unrest, health issues, kidnapping, piracy, and lack of availability of routine consular services.</b></p> <p><b>Country Summary:</b>&nbsp;Violent crime, such as kidnapping and murder, is common throughout Somalia. Illegal roadblocks are widespread.</p> <p>The U.S. government has extremely limited ability to help U.S. citizens in Somalia because there is no permanent consular officer in Somalia, including the Somaliland region.<b> If a traveler’s passport is lost, stolen, or expires, or the traveler becomes destitute</b> the U.S. government may be unable to assist.</p> <p>Some schools and other facilities act as “rehabilitation” centers and “de-westernization” camps. These facilities exist throughout Somalia with little or no licensing and oversight. Reports of physical abuse are common. People also report being held against their will in these facilities.</p> <p>There are frequent reports of U.S. citizens who have their passports taken by family members, leaving them unable to depart Somalia. This often occurs when U.S. citizens travel to Somalia to visit family or attend an event. Some adult U.S. citizens are then unable to leave the international airport without explicit consent from their family.</p> <p>Terrorists continue to plot kidnappings, bombings, and other attacks in Somalia. They may attack with little or no warning, targeting airports, seaports, and government buildings. Terrorists also target hotels, restaurants, shopping areas, and other places that attract large crowds and tourists. Government, military, and other convoys, including those carrying tourists are also targets. Methods of attack can include car bombs, suicide bombers, individual attackers, and rocket fire, among others. While some areas have experienced less severe terrorist activity, such as the Somaliland region, terrorist attacks involving the indiscriminate use of explosive devices and other weapons can take place anywhere in Somalia at any time without warning. The U.S. Embassy imposes strict limits on employee movement in Mogadishu based on the critical threat environment.</p> <p>Civil unrest, including protests and demonstrations, occurs throughout Somalia and can sometimes be violent.</p> <p>Medical facilities in Somalia have limited capacity and are often absent in rural areas.</p> <p>Pirates are active in the waters off the Horn of Africa, especially off the coast of Puntland.</p> <p>Due to risks to civil aviation operating within or in the vicinity of Somalia, the Federal Aviation Administration has issued a Special Federal Aviation Regulation.&nbsp; For more information, U.S. citizens should consult the&nbsp;<a href="https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/traveladvisories/traveladvisories/somalia-travel-advisory.html/#ExternalPopup">Federal Aviation Administration’s Prohibitions, Restrictions, and Notices</a>.</p> <p>Read the&nbsp;<a href="https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/International-Travel-Country-Information-Pages/Somalia.html">country information page</a>&nbsp;for additional information on travel to Somalia.</p> <p><b>If you decide to travel to Somalia:</b></p> <ul> <li>Review your personal security plan and visit our page on&nbsp;<a href="https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/travelers-with-special-considerations/high-risk-travelers.html">Travel to High-Risk Areas</a>.</li> <li>Make a plan to exit Somalia if the situation gets worse.

<summary type="html"><p><b>Updated to reflect additional information on terrorism and security.</b></p> <p>Do not travel to Yemen due to <b>terrorism, civil unrest, crime, health risks, kidnapping, armed conflict, </b>and<b> landmines</b>.</p> <p><b>Country Summary:</b>&nbsp;The U.S. Embassy in Sana’a suspended its operations in February 2015. The U.S. government is unable to provide emergency services to U.S. citizens in Yemen.</p> <p>The Department of State has designated Ansarallah, commonly referred to as the Houthis, as a Specially Designated Global Terrorist group. Other terrorist groups, including Al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP) and Islamic State affiliates, continue to plot and conduct attacks in Yemen – most notably in al-Bayda, Abyan, and Shabwah governorates. Terrorists may attack with little or no warning, targeting public sites, transportation hubs, markets/shopping malls, and local government facilities. Additionally, there is a continuing threat of kidnapping/detention by terrorists, criminal elements, and/or non-government actors. Employees of foreign organizations may be targeted for attack or kidnapping.</p> <p>A civil war continues in Yemen. While reduced overall levels of violence continue following the April 2022 truce, instability, and ongoing threats of armed conflict, particularly along the frontlines in central Yemen, remain at a severe level. Due to the ongoing civil unrest and weak government institutions, travelers should not rely on significant assistance from local authorities. Foreign nationals are frequently the target of kidnapping and carjacking, particularly when traveling outside of urban areas.</p> <p>Military conflict has caused destruction of basic infrastructure, housing, medical facilities, schools, and power and water utilities. This destruction limits the availability of electricity, clean water, and medical care in affected areas. It also often hampers the ability of humanitarian organizations to deliver critically needed food, medicine, and water. Landmines exist throughout Yemen.</p> <p>Widespread violent crime and/or organized crime are present in Yemen. Local law enforcement may have limited or no ability or willingness to respond to serious crimes.</p> <p>As a result of the deterioration of health services, Yemen is experiencing the re-emergence of infectious diseases, such as cholera, polio, and measles. There is a limited availability of medicine and medical supplies, and adequate medical treatment is unavailable.</p> <p>There is a very high risk of kidnapping and detention of U.S. citizens in Yemen, particularly dual U.S.-Yemeni citizens. U.S. citizens, particularly young people, are also at risk of kidnapping for purposes of forced marriage, sometimes involving force, fraud, or coercion by family members in the United States and/or Yemen. The Houthis, who control Sana’a, have detained U.S. citizens, including dual U.S.-Yemeni citizens. U.S. citizens, including dual nationals, have faced difficulty – including lengthy delays – when attempting to depart Yemen.</p> <p>Commercial flights have departed from Aden and Sana’a to multiple destinations in the region. Contact airlines and travel companies directly for the most current information on flights departing Yemen.</p> <p>Companies outside of Yemen have misrepresented the security situation on the Yemeni island of Socotra. They offer tourist visits, including by facilitating unofficial and invalid &quot;visas.&quot; Only the sovereign Republic of Yemen government can issue valid Yemeni visas. Companies that arrange such visits are putting tourists in danger, including legal jeopardy. While security conditions may be less volatile than on the mainland, the U.S. government has no presence and no way to assist U.S. citizens who travel there. U.S. citizens should not travel to Socotra or any other part of Yemen.</p> <p>Due to risks to civil aviation operating within or in the vicinity of Yemen, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has issued a Notice to Air Missions (NOTAM) and/or a Special Federal Aviation Regulation (SFAR). For more information U.S. citizens should consult the <a href="https://www.faa.gov/air_traffic/publications/us_restrictions/">Federal Aviation Administration’s Prohibitions, Restrictions and Notices</a>.</p> <p>Due to risks to commercial shipping operating within or in the vicinity of Yemen territorial waters, the Department of Transportation’s Maritime Administration (MARAD) has issued a Maritime Advisory. For more information U.S. citizens should consult the <a href="https://www.maritime.dot.gov/msci/maritime-security-communications-industry-msci-web-portal">Maritime Administration’s Maritime Security Communications with Industry (MSCI)</a>.</p> <p>Additionally, the Commandant of the Coast Guard has determined that effective anti-terrorism measures are not in place in Yemen’s ports and has imposed conditions of entry on vessels that arrive in U.S. ports having visited ports in Yemen. Mariners and passengers traveling through the ports of Yemen should exercise caution.</p> <p>Read the&nbsp;<a href="https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/International-Travel-Country-Information-Pages/Yemen.html">country information page</a>&nbsp;for additional information on travel to Yemen.</p> <p>If, despite this Travel Advisory, you decide to travel to Yemen:</p> <ul> <li>Visit our website for&nbsp;<a href="https://travel.state.gov/content/passports/en/go/TraveltoHighRiskAreas.html">Travel to High-Risk Areas</a>.</li> <li>Make contingency plans to leave the country without U.S. government assistance.</li> <li>Draft a will and designate appropriate insurance beneficiaries and/or power of attorney.</li> <li>Discuss a plan with loved ones regarding care/custody of children, pets, property, belongings, non-liquid assets (collections, artwork, etc.), funeral wishes, etc.</li> <li>Share important documents, login information, and points of contact with loved ones so that they can manage your affairs, if you are unable to return as planned to the United States.</li> <li>Be aware of your surroundings.</li> <li>Establish your own personal security plan in coordination with your employer or host organization or consider consulting with a professional security organization.</li> <li>Develop a communication plan with family and/or your employer or host organization so that they can monitor your safety and location as you travel through high-risk areas.

<summary type="html"><p><b><i>Updated to reflect the risk of wrongful detention</i></b></p> <p>Do not travel to Syria due to the risk of&nbsp;<b>terrorism, civil unrest, kidnapping or hostage taking, and armed conflict. </b>Exercise increased caution due to the risk of <b>wrongful detention. </b></p> <p><b>Country Summary:</b> The U.S. Embassy in Damascus suspended its operations in February 2012. Czechia serves as the protecting power for the United States in Syria. The U.S. government is unable to provide any routine or emergency consular services to U.S. citizens in Syria.</p> <p>Syria has experienced active armed conflict since 2011. No part of Syria is safe from violence. Hostage taking by armed groups, wrongful detentions, the use of chemical warfare, shelling, and aerial bombardment of civilian centers pose significant risk of death or serious injury. The destruction of infrastructure, housing, medical facilities, schools, and power and water utilities has also increased hardships inside the country.</p> <p>The U.S. government strongly warns private U.S. citizens against traveling to Syria to engage in armed conflict. The U.S. government does not support this activity. U.S. citizens who undertake such activity face extreme personal risks, including hostage taking by armed groups, wrongful detentions, injury, or death. Our ability to provide consular assistance to individuals who are injured or kidnapped, or to the families of individuals who die in the conflict, is extremely limited.</p> <p>Protests and demonstrations are quelled by government forces through aggressive tactics and protestors, activists, and political dissenters are routinely detained without access to legal representation or the ability to communicate with friends and family.</p> <p>Terrorist groups are active in Syria. Parts of Syria have experienced recent increases in incidents of bombings, IEDs, and assassinations. Fighting on behalf of or providing other forms of support to designated terrorist organizations, including ISIS and al-Qaeda affiliates, can constitute the provision of material support for terrorism or a foreign terrorist organization, which is a crime under U.S. law that can result in penalties including prison time and large fines.</p> <p>There is an ongoing risk of hostage taking of U.S. citizens and other foreign nationals throughout the country. U.S. citizens are also targets of abduction and/or wrongful detention by the Syrian government. Those in detention do not have access to fair judicial process or medical attention. Government detention centers are known to be unsanitary facilities where widespread cruel, inhumane, or degrading treatment of detainees has been documented, as well as torture and extrajudicial killings. Minors, persons with physical, sensory, or mental disabilities, and elderly have frequently been victims of unjust detention. The Syrian government has also been implicated in the enforced or involuntary disappearance of more than 100,000 individuals, including medical and humanitarian workers, journalists, human rights activists, political opposition, and additionally those suspected of affiliation with these groups and their family members. Only the Syrian government can issue a valid entry visa to Syria. Failure to obtain a legitimate entry visa directly from the Syrian government could result in detention.</p> <p>Due to risks of operating civilian aircraft within or in the vicinity of Syria, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has issued a Notice to Air Missions (NOTAM) and/or a Special Federal Aviation Regulation (SFAR).

<category label="Threat-Level" term="Level 4: Do Not Travel"/>
<summary type="html"><p><i><b>Reissued after periodic review with minor edits.</b></i></p> <p><b>Do not travel to Russia</b> due to the consequences of the full-scale invasion of Ukraine by Russian military forces. U.S. citizens may face harassment or detention by Russian security officials, arbitrary enforcement of local laws, limited flights into and out of Russia, and the possibility of terrorism. The U.S. Embassy has limited ability to assist U.S. citizens in Russia. The Department has determined that there is a continued risk of wrongful detention of U.S. nationals by Russian authorities. <b>U.S. citizens residing or traveling in Russia should leave immediately.</b></p> <p>The U.S. government has limited ability to help U.S. citizens in Russia, especially outside of Moscow. The U.S. Embassy is operating with reduced staffing, and the Russian government has restricted travel for embassy personnel. Furthermore, all U.S. consulates in Russia have suspended operations, including consular services.</p> <p>There have been reports of drone attacks and explosions near the border with Ukraine as well as in Moscow, Kazan, and St. Petersburg. In an emergency, you should follow instructions from local authorities and seek shelter.</p> <p>Russia may refuse to recognize your U.S. citizenship if you are a dual U.S.-Russian citizen or have a claim to Russian citizenship. Russia has denied consular officers visits to detained dual U.S.-Russian citizens. The Russian government has forced citizens with dual nationality to join the Russian military and prevented them from leaving the country. In 2022, the Russian government mobilized citizens for its invasion of Ukraine. Military conscription continues.</p> <p>In Russia, the rights to peaceful assembly and free speech are not always protected. U.S. citizens should avoid protests and taking photos of security staff at these events. Russian authorities have arrested U.S. citizens who joined protests. Moreover, there are many reports of Russians being detained for social media posts.</p> <p>U.S. citizens should know that U.S. credit and debit cards no longer work in Russia. Due to sanctions, sending electronic money transfers from the U.S. to Russia is nearly impossible.</p> <p>Commercial flight options are minimal and are often unavailable on short notice.&nbsp;If you wish to depart Russia, you should make independent arrangements. The U.S. Embassy has limited ability to assist U.S. citizens in leaving the country, and transportation options may suddenly become even more restricted.</p> <p>Click&nbsp;<a href="https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/informationforuscitizeninrussia.html">here</a>&nbsp;for Information for U.S. Citizens Seeking to Depart Russia.</p> <p>U.S. Embassy staff generally are not allowed to fly on Russian airlines due to safety concerns. Recently, the FAA downgraded Russia's air safety rating from Category 1 to Category 2. Additionally, the FAA banned U.S. flights in some Russian areas, including the Moscow Flight Information Region (FIR), the Samara FIR (UWWW), and the Rostov-na-Donu (URRV) FIR within 160NM of the boundaries of the Dnipro (UKDV) Flight Information Regions. Check the <a href="https://www.faa.gov/air_traffic/publications/us_restrictions#RussianFederation">FAA's Prohibitions, Restrictions, and Notices</a> for more information.</p> <p><b>Country Summary:&nbsp;</b></p> <p>Russian officials have interrogated and threatened U.S. citizens without cause. This includes former and current U.S. government and military personnel and private U.S. citizens engaged in business. U.S. citizens may become victims of harassment, mistreatment, and extortion.</p> <p>Russian authorities may not notify the U.S. Embassy about the detention of a U.S. citizen and may delay U.S. consular assistance. Russian security services also target foreign and international organizations they consider “undesirable.”</p> <p>Russian security services have arrested U.S. citizens on false charges, denied them fair treatment, and convicted them without credible evidence. Furthermore, Russian authorities have opened questionable investigations against U.S. citizens engaged in religious activity. U.S. citizens should avoid travel to Russia.</p> <p>Russia's invasion of Ukraine has destabilized security in southwestern Russia. In October 2022, the Russian government declared martial law in the following border areas with Ukraine: Bryansk, Kursk, Belgorod, Voronezh, Rostov, and Krasnodar. Under martial law, authorities can set curfews, seize property, and restrict movement. The Russian government may detain foreigners, forcibly relocate residents, and limit public gatherings. U.S. citizens should avoid all travel to these areas.</p> <p>Russian authorities have questioned, detained, and arrested people for “acting against Russia's interests.” Local authorities have targeted people for posting on social media or supporting &quot;anti-Russian&quot; groups and punished individuals for criticizing the government or military. The Russian government's current &quot;LGBT propaganda&quot; law bans discussion of LGBTQI+ related topics. In November 2023, the Supreme Court labeled the so-called &quot;international LGBT movement&quot; as extremist. This decision effectively made it a crime to support the human rights of LGBTQI+ persons in Russia.</p> <p>Terrorists continue to plan attacks in Russia. The March 2024 Crocus City Hall incident proved they can strike suddenly. Terrorists may target tourist areas, transport hubs, and markets. They may also target government buildings, hotels, clubs, restaurants, and places of worship. Parks, events, schools, and airports are also potential targets.&nbsp; U.S. government employees under Embassy (Chief of Mission) security responsibility are not permitted to travel to the North Caucasus, including Chechnya and Mt. Elbrus. U.S. citizens should avoid travel to those areas.</p> <p>The international community does not recognize Russia’s annexation of Crimea and does not acknowledge Russia’s purported annexation of Donetsk, Luhansk, Kherson, and Zaporizhzhya. Russia staged its full-scale invasion of Ukraine, in part, from occupied Crimea and there is a heavy Russian military presence in these areas. There is intense fighting across these regions and Russian authorities there have abused both foreigners and locals. Authorities have specifically targeted individuals who are seen as challenging Russia’s authority.</p> <p>The U.S. Embassy in Kyiv administers consular services to U.S. citizens in Crimea, Donetsk, Luhansk, Kherson, and Zaporizhzhya. However, the conflict limits the Embassy's ability to help U.S. citizens in these areas.</p> <p>Read the&nbsp;<a href="https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/International-Travel-Country-Information-Pages/RussianFederation.html">country information page</a>&nbsp;for additional information on travel to Russia.</p> <p>If you decide to travel to Russia:</p> <ul> <li>Read the information on <a href="https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/emergencies/what-state-dept-can-cant-do-crisis.html">what the U.S. government can and cannot do to assist you in an emergency overseas</a>.</li> <li>Consider the risks involved in having dual U.S.- Russian nationality.</li> <li>Have a contingency plan in place that does not rely on U.S. government help.

The development of a professional tourist police corps, institution of a 911 system in many parts of the country, and a concentration of resources in resort areas means these tend to be better policed than urban areas like Santo Domingo. The wide availability of weapons, the use and trade of illicit drugs, and a weak criminal justice system contribute to the high level of criminality on the broader scale.</p> <p>Read the <a href="https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/International-Travel-Country-Information-Pages/DominicanRepublic.html">country information page</a> for additional information on travel to the Dominican Republic.</p> <p>If you decide to travel to the Dominican Republic:</p> <ul> <li>Be aware of your surroundings.</li> <li>Do not physically resist any robbery attempt.</li> <li>Do not display signs of wealth, such as wearing expensive watches or jewelry.</li> <li>Follow the advice of resort and tour operators regarding local safety and security concerns.</li> <li>Enroll in the <a href="https://step.state.gov/">Smart Traveler Enrollment Program (STEP)</a> to receive Alerts and make it easier to locate you in an emergency.</li> <li>Follow the Department of State on <a href="http://facebook.com/travelgov">Facebook</a> and <a href="http://twitter.com/travelgov">Twitter</a>.</li> <li>Review the <a href="https://www.osac.gov/Content/Browse/Report?subContentTypes=Country%20Security%20Report">Country Security Report</a> for the Dominican Republic.</li> <li>Prepare a contingency plan for emergency situations.&nbsp; Review the <a href="https://travel.state.gov/content/passports/en/go/checklist.html">Traveler’s Checklist</a>.</li> <li>Visit the CDC page for the latest <a href="https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/destinations/list">Travel Health Information</a> related to your travel.</li> </ul> </summary>

<title type="html">Burma (Myanmar) - Level 4: Do Not Travel</title>

<category label="Threat-Level" term="Level 4: Do Not Travel"/>
<summary type="html"><p><b>Updated Country Summary, to include information about implementation of a conscription law, and changes to the “<i>If you decide to travel to Burma”</i> section.</b></p> <p>Do not travel to Burma due to&nbsp;<b>civil unrest, armed conflict, and arbitrary enforcement of local laws</b>. Reconsider travel to Burma due to&nbsp;<b>limited and/or inadequate healthcare and emergency medical resources, and areas with land mines and unexploded ordnances</b>. Exercise increased caution due to&nbsp;<b>wrongful detentions</b>.</p> <p><b>COUNTRY SUMMARY:&nbsp;</b>The Burma military regime detained and deposed elected government officials in a February 2021 coup d'état. Protests and demonstrations against military rule continue, often on significant dates. The military has responded to those protests by&nbsp;<b>arbitrarily detaining individuals</b>&nbsp;and with the indiscriminate use of deadly force against protesters and bystanders.</p> <p>The Department of State has determined that the&nbsp;<b>risk of wrongful detention</b>&nbsp;of U.S. nationals by the military regime exists.</p> <p>The U.S. government has limited ability to provide emergency services to U.S. citizens in Burma due to security concerns amidst the ongoing armed conflict. This may be of particular concern to crime victims outside of Rangoon.</p> <p>To mitigate safety and security risks, U.S. government employees’ dependents, under the age of 21, cannot reside in Burma with their U.S. government parent assigned to work in Burma.</p> <p><b>Civil unrest&nbsp;and armed conflict</b>&nbsp;occur throughout Burma. The level of&nbsp;civil unrest and armed conflict&nbsp;varies significantly between and within states and regions and may change at any time.</p> <p>Civil unrest and armed violence due to fighting between the military regime and various ethnic groups and militias occur particularly in parts of Chin, Kachin, Kayin, Rakhine, and Shan States, as well as in Sagaing and Magway regions.</p> <p>Improvised explosive devices (IEDs) are used in the ongoing armed conflicts, including within the greater Rangoon area. From January to December 2023, the U.S. Embassy in Rangoon calculated an average of fifteen IEDs per month detonated against regime targets, while an average of eight unexploded IEDs were discovered and safely disposed of per month by security authorities. Outside of Rangoon, there have been IED attacks against checkpoints and other critical infrastructure.</p> <p>While <b>land mines and unexploded ordnance (UXO)&nbsp;exist throughout Burma</b>, NGOs working on this issue state the greatest concerns are in Shan, Chin, and Kachin State. The locations of landmines and UXO are often not marked or otherwise unidentifiable.</p> <p>The military regime&nbsp;<b>arbitrarily enforces local laws</b>, including <b>often </b>detaining individuals<b> without respect for their fair trial guarantees or other applicable rights</b>. Foreigners, including U.S. citizens, are not excluded from this practice. U.S. citizens traveling or residing in Burma may be detained and regime authorities could deny access to U.S. consular services or information about the alleged crime.</p> <p>Local law enforcement officials may detain and/or deport U.S. citizens for speaking out or protesting against the military regime, including on their personal social media accounts, and for sending private electronic messages critical of the military regime. Facebook and X (Twitter) are banned in Burma. Police have sought bribes from individuals using a virtual private network (VPN) to access social media sites even though VPN use is legal.</p> <p>Burma has&nbsp;<b>limited and/or inadequate healthcare and emergency medical resources</b>&nbsp;due to critical staffing shortages in the public sector health workforce. Importation of medical supplies, including medicine, into Burma is not consistent and medical prescriptions and over-the-counter medicine may not be available.</p> <p>Burma’s <b>military conscription law</b> was first introduced in 2010 but historically was not widely implemented. The military regime officially implemented the law in April 2024. In general, Burmese males aged 18 to 35 and Burmese females aged 18 to 27 will need to register for military service and report for duty if ordered by regime authorities. Burmese males aged 18 to 45 and Burmese females aged 18 to 35 in specific expert/professional occupations must serve if called upon by the regime. For more information, please refer to the Myanmar People’s Military Service Law (State Peace and Development Council Law No. 27/2010), also known as the Public Military Service Law. The military regime may refuse to acknowledge U.S.-Burmese dual nationals’ U.S. citizenship, prevent their departure from Burma, and/or conscript them into the military. U.S.-Burmese nationals should consider this issue before traveling to Burma.</p> <p>Read the <a href="https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/International-Travel-Country-Information-Pages/Burma.html">Country Information page</a> for additional information on travel to Burma.</p> <p><b>If you decide to travel to Burma:</b></p> <ul> <li>Enroll in the&nbsp;<a href="https://step.state.gov/step/">Smart Traveler Enrollment Program (STEP)&nbsp;</a>to receive Alerts and make it easier to locate you in an emergency.</li> <li>Follow the Department of State on&nbsp;<a href="https://www.facebook.com/travelgov/">Facebook&nbsp;</a>and&nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/travelgov">Twitter</a>.</li> <li>Follow the Embassy on&nbsp;<a href="https://www.facebook.com/usembassy.rangoon/">Facebook</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/USEmbassyBurma?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor">Twitter</a>.</li> <li>Follow the Embassy’s Consular Section on&nbsp;<a href="https://www.facebook.com/consularrangoon/">Facebook</a>.</li> <li>Review the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.osac.gov/Content/Browse/Report?subContentTypes=Country%20Security%20Report">Country Security Report&nbsp;</a>for Burma.</li> <li>Visit the CDC page for the latest&nbsp;<a href="https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/destinations/list">Travel Health Information</a>&nbsp;related to your travel.&nbsp;</li> <li>Purchase travel medical insurance that covers Burma and includes medical evacuation.&nbsp;</li> <li>Do not touch unknown metal objects and avoid traveling off well-used roads, tracks, and paths due to risk of unexploded ordnance.&nbsp;</li> <li>Keep travel documents up to date and easily accessible.&nbsp;</li> <li>Make contingency plans to leave the country.&nbsp;</li> <li>Review local laws and conditions before traveling.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li> <li>Review our website on <a href="https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/travelers-with-special-considerations/Dual-Nationality-Travelers.html">Dual-Nationality</a>.&nbsp;</li> <li>Visit our website for&nbsp;<a href="https://travel.state.gov/content/passports/en/go/TraveltoHighRiskAreas.html">High-Risk Area Travelers</a>.&nbsp; &nbsp;</li> <li>Share important documents, login information, and points of contact with loved ones so that they can manage your affairs if you are unable to return as planned to the United States.&nbsp;</li> <li>Review <a href="https://www.ready.gov/financial-preparedness">Ready.gov’s Financial Preparedness webpage</a>.</li> <li>Develop a communication plan with family and/or your employer or host organization.</li> <li>Erase any sensitive photos, comments, or other materials that could be considered controversial or provocative by local groups from your social media pages, cameras, laptops, and other electronic devices prior to travel.</li> </ul> </summary>

<category label="Threat-Level" term="Level 4: Do Not Travel"/>
<summary type="html"><p><b>Updated to reflect the termination of Ordered Departure of non-emergency U.S. government employees and eligible family members.</b></p> <p>Do not travel to Iraq due to <b>terrorism, kidnapping, armed conflict, civil unrest, and Mission Iraq’s limited capacity to provide support to U.S. citizens.</b></p> <p>On April 1, 2024, the Department terminated the Ordered Departure status for U.S. Embassy Baghdad and U.S. Consulate General Erbil. However, the Travel Advisory level for Iraq remains at Level 4, advising that U.S. citizens not travel to Iraq.</p> <p><b>Country Summary:</b>&nbsp;U.S. citizens in Iraq face high risks to their safety and security, including the potential for violence and kidnapping. Terrorist and insurgent groups regularly attack Iraqi security forces and civilians. Anti-U.S. militias threaten U.S. citizens and international companies throughout Iraq. Attacks using improvised explosive devices, indirect fire, and unmanned aerial vehicles occur in many areas of the country, including Baghdad and other major cities. In an emergency, consular services to U.S. citizens in Iraq are limited due to severe restrictions on the movements of U.S. government personnel.</p> <p>Demonstrations, protests, and strikes occur frequently throughout the country. These events can develop quickly without prior notice, often interrupting traffic, transportation, and other services, and sometimes turning violent.</p> <p>Do not travel near Iraq’s northern borders due to the continued threat of attacks by terrorist groups, armed conflict, aerial bombardment, and civil unrest. U.S. citizens should especially avoid areas near armed groups in northern Iraq, which have been targeted with aerial strikes by neighboring countries’ militaries.</p> <p>U.S. citizens should not travel through Iraq to engage in armed conflict in Syria, where they would face extreme personal risks (kidnapping, injury, or death) and legal risks (arrest, fines, and expulsion). The Kurdistan Regional Government in Iraq has stated that it will impose prison sentences of up to ten years on individuals who illegally cross the Iraq-Syria border. Additionally, fighting on behalf of or supporting designated terrorist organizations is a crime under U.S. law that can result in prison sentences and large fines in the United States.</p> <p>Because of security concerns, U.S. government personnel in Baghdad are instructed not to use Baghdad International Airport. Due to risks to civil aviation operating in the Baghdad Flight Information Region, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has extended its Special Federal Aviation Regulation (SFAR) prohibiting certain flights at altitudes below 32,000 feet for an additional two years. For more information, U.S. citizens should consult the&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="https://www.faa.gov/air_traffic/publications/us_restrictions#Iraq">Federal Aviation Administration’s Prohibitions, Restrictions, and Notices.</a></p> <p>Read the <a href="https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/International-Travel-Country-Information-Pages/Iraq.html">country information page</a> for additional information on travel to Iraq.</p> <p>If you decide to travel to Iraq:</p> <ul> <li>Establish your own personal security plan in coordination with your employer or host organization or consider consulting with a professional security organization.</li> <li>Draft a will and designate appropriate insurance beneficiaries and/or power of attorney.</li> <li>Discuss a plan with loved ones regarding care/custody of children, pets, property, belongings, non-liquid assets (collections, artwork, etc.), funeral wishes, etc.</li> <li>Share important documents, login information, and points of contact with loved ones so that they can manage your affairs if you are unable to return as planned to the United States.</li> <li>Visit our website for <a href="https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/travelers-with-special-considerations/high-risk-travelers.html">Travel to High-Risk Areas</a>.</li> <li>Enroll in the <a href="https://step.state.gov/step/">Smart Traveler Enrollment Program (STEP)</a> to receive alerts and make it easier to locate you in an emergency.</li> <li>Follow the Department of State on <a href="https://www.facebook.com/travelgov/">Facebook</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/StateDept?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor">Twitter</a>.</li> <li>Review the <a href="https://www.osac.gov/Content/Browse/Report?subContentTypes=Country%20Security%20Report">Country Security Report</a> for Iraq.</li> <li>Visit the CDC website for the latest <a href="https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/destinations/list">Travel Health Information</a> related to your travel.</li> <li>Prepare a contingency plan for emergency situations.

Violent crime, such as murder, assault, kidnapping, and armed robbery, is prevalent and widespread. The rate of violent crime is significantly higher in areas where transnational criminal organizations are concentrated.</p> <p>Demonstrations occur frequently throughout the country, usually motivated by political and/or economic factors. Demonstrators routinely block local roads and major highways, often without prior notice which can lead to disruption in access to critical infrastructure. &nbsp;</p> <p>Outside of Ecuador’s major towns and cities, much of the country’s territory is sparsely populated and isolated. Government assistance may be very limited and can lead to significant delays for assistance to U.S. citizens in remote areas.</p> <p><b>Land Border Restrictions</b>: All foreign citizens entering the country via land border crossings from Colombia or Peru are required to present an apostilled certificate showing a lack of criminal record. Further information is available on the <a href="https://www.turismo.gob.ec/requisitos-de-ingreso-al-ecuador-continental-e-islas-galapagos/">Ministry of Tourism’s webpage</a> and at <a href="https://ecuador.travel/viaja-seguro/">Ecuador.Travel</a>. All U.S. citizens planning to enter Ecuador via a land border should comply with this requirement. See <a href="https://travel.state.gov/content/travel.html">Travel.State.Gov</a>’s <a href="https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/records-and-authentications/authenticate-your-document/office-of-authentications.html">Office of Authentications webpage</a> and <a href="https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/while-abroad/criminal-record-checks.html">Criminal Records Check webpage</a> for information on how to obtain a criminal record check and apostille from the United States.

<summary type="html"><p>Exercise increased caution due to the&nbsp;<b>arbitrary enforcement of local laws</b>.</p> <p><b>Summary:</b>&nbsp;Hong Kong SAR authorities have dramatically restricted civil liberties since the Government of the People’s Republic of China (PRC) imposed the Law of the PRC on Safeguarding National Security in the Hong Kong SAR on June 30, 2020. Following the Hong Kong SAR government’s enactment of its own Safeguarding National Security Ordinance on March 23, 2024, Hong Kong SAR authorities are expected to take additional actions to further restrict civil liberties.</p> <p>The 2020 National Security Law outlines a broad range of vaguely defined offenses, such as acts of secession, subversion, terrorism, and collusion with foreign entities. The 2024 Safeguarding National Security Ordinance builds on this framework with additional vaguely defined offenses, such as treason, insurrection, theft of state secrets, sabotage against public infrastructure, and external interference. According to the legislation, these offenses are applicable to foreign nationals within the Hong Kong SAR and to individuals, including U.S. citizens and permanent residents, located outside its borders. Under these provisions, anyone who criticizes the PRC and/or Hong Kong SAR authorities may face arrest, detention, expulsion, and/or prosecution. Hong Kong SAR authorities are attempting to enforce these provisions against individuals, including U.S. citizens and permanent residents, residing outside of their jurisdiction by offering cash rewards for information leading to their arrests in the Hong Kong SAR.</p> <p><b>Dual Nationality:</b>&nbsp;The Hong Kong SAR government does not recognize dual nationality. Dual U.S.-PRC citizens and U.S. citizens of Chinese descent may be subject to additional scrutiny and harassment. If you are a dual U.S.-PRC citizen and enter Hong Kong SAR on a U.S. passport, and you are detained or arrested, PRC authorities are under an obligation to notify the U.S. Embassy or a U.S. Consulate General of your detention and to allow U.S. consular officials to have access to you. In practice, however, U.S. consular officers may be prevented from providing consular assistance, even to those who have entered on their U.S. passports.

<summary type="html"><p><b>Reissued after periodic review with minor edits.</b></p> <p>Reconsider travel to Papua New Guinea due to <b>crime, civil unrest,</b> and <b>piracy</b>. Exercise increased caution due to <b>kidnapping, unexploded ordnance, inconsistent availability of healthcare services, and potential for natural disasters.</b> Some areas have increased risk. Read the entire Travel Advisory.</p> <p><b>Do not travel to:</b></p> <ul> <li>Central Bougainville, particularly areas near the Panguna mine, due to <b>civil unrest</b>.</li> <li>The Highlands region, other than the towns of Mt. Hagen and Goroka, due to <b>civil unrest</b>.</li> </ul> <p><b>Country Summary:</b> <b>Violent crime</b>, including sexual assault, carjackings, home invasions, and armed robberies, is common. There have been reports of criminals attacking resorts popular with foreign tourists to steal goods and money. Tensions between communal or tribal groups may lead to <b>civil unrest</b> involving violence and can occur without warning. Police presence is limited outside of the capital, Port Moresby, and police may be unable to assist due to limited resources. The U.S. government has limited ability to provide emergency services to U.S. citizens outside of Port Moresby due to limited transportation infrastructure. U.S. government employees must obtain authorization before traveling to areas of concern, including the central part of Bougainville and the provinces of Southern Highlands, Western Highlands (excluding Mt. Hagen), Eastern Highlands (excluding Goroka), Hela, Enga, Jiwaka, and other areas of Papua New Guinea where one is unable to fly directly.</p> <p><b>Piracy</b> is active in the waters surrounding Papua New Guinea. Travelers by boat should reconsider travel to the Bismarck and Solomon Seas along Papua New Guinea's north and eastern coasts. In 2021 and 2022, the Embassy was aware of at least three occasions in which sailboats operated by or carrying U.S. citizens were boarded by criminals. The criminals, who have been known to use physical violence, robbed the boats, and in one incident, severely injured the captain when he attempted to fight back.</p> <p>Visit our website on <a href="https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/emergencies/internl-maritime-piracy-robbery.html">International Maritime Piracy and Armed Robbery at Sea</a>.</p> <p><b>Kidnapping</b> for ransom or political influence occurs in Papua New Guinea, though foreign nationals are not frequently targeted. In February 2023, a foreign citizen was kidnapped. In late 2022, foreign citizens employed by an international company were kidnapped and held for several days. &nbsp;</p> <p>Travelers should exercise increased caution when traveling in remote areas of Papua New Guinea due to the presence of <b>unexploded ordnance (UXO)</b> remaining from World War II. UXO is discovered infrequently throughout the country, often on smaller islands.</p> <p>Papua New Guinea has<b> inconsistent availability of healthcare services</b> which may be difficult to obtain outside of Port Moresby. Pharmaceuticals may be scarce or unavailable.</p> <p>Papua New Guinea is subject to periodic seismic activity and is home to several active volcanoes.

<summary type="html"><p><b><i>Updated to reflect safety consideration when using GPS navigation.&nbsp;</i></b></p> <p>Exercise increased caution in South Africa due to <b>crime</b> and <b>civil unrest</b>.&nbsp;</p> <p><b>Country Summary:</b>  Violent crime, such as armed robbery, rape, carjacking, mugging, and &quot;smash-and-grab&quot; attacks on vehicles, is common. There is a higher risk of violent crime in the central business districts of major cities after dark.</p> <p>Using GPS navigation can lead to unsafe routes. GPS navigation may suggest shortcuts through townships&nbsp;as the quickest preferred route but can lead to increased risks of crime.</p> <p>There have been incidents in which tourists traveling in Cape Town while using GPS navigation apps have been routed through residential areas with high rates of violent crime. The safest approach to return a rental car to Cape Town International Airport is to take the <u>N2 highway</u> and follow signs to Airport Approach Rd (<u>exit 16</u>). Alternatively, request the rental car company to collect your vehicle and subsequently arrange an airport transfer from established taxi companies or established ridesharing services to reach the airport.</p> <p>Demonstrations, protests, and strikes occur frequently. These can develop quickly without prior notification, often interrupting traffic, transportation, and other services; such events have the potential to turn violent.&nbsp;</p> <p>Please see our <a href="https://za.usembassy.gov/category/alert/" adhocenable="false">Alerts</a> for up-to-date information.&nbsp;</p> <p>Read the <a href="https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/International-Travel-Country-Information-Pages/SouthAfrica.html">country information page</a> for additional information on travel to South Africa.&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;If you decide to travel to South Africa:&nbsp;</p> <ul> <li>Research your route in advance, stay on major highways, avoid shortcuts through townships, and avoid reliance on GPS navigation apps.</li> <li>Avoid walking alone, especially after dark.&nbsp;</li> <li>Avoid visiting informal settlement areas unless you are with someone familiar with the area.&nbsp;</li> <li>Do not display cash or valuables.&nbsp;</li> <li>Drive with doors locked and windows closed.&nbsp;</li> <li>Always carry a copy of your U.S. passport and visa (if applicable).

<summary type="html"><p><b>Updated with additional water safety information.</b></p> <p>Exercise increased caution in The Bahamas due to<b>&nbsp;crime</b>. </p> <p><b>Country Summary</b>:&nbsp;The majority of crime occurs on New Providence (Nassau) and Grand Bahama (Freeport) islands. In Nassau, practice increased vigilance in the “Over the Hill” area (south of Shirley Street) where gang-on-gang violence has resulted in a high homicide rate primarily affecting the local population. Violent crime, such as burglaries, armed robberies, and sexual assaults, occur in both tourist and non-tourist areas. Be vigilant when staying at short-term vacation rental properties where private security companies do not have a presence.   </p> <p> Activities involving commercial recreational watercraft, including water tours, are not consistently regulated.&nbsp;Watercraft may be poorly maintained, and some operators may not have safety certifications.  Always review and heed local weather and marine alerts before engaging in water-based activities. Commercial watercraft operators have discretion to operate their vessels regardless of weather forecasts; injuries and fatalities have occurred. Due to these safety concerns, U.S. government personnel are not permitted to use independently operated jet-ski rentals on New Providence and Paradise Islands.   </p> <p>Never swim alone, regardless of your age or level of swimming skills.&nbsp; Keep within your fitness and swimming capabilities. Be mindful of sharks when swimming and engaging in water activities, as there have been recent fatal and non-fatal incidents involving sharks.&nbsp; Be aware of weather and water conditions and heed local warnings.&nbsp; </p> <p>Read the <a href="https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/International-Travel-Country-Information-Pages/Bahamas.html">country information page</a>&nbsp;for additional information on travel to The Bahamas.&nbsp;</p> <p>If you decide to travel to The Bahamas:  </p> <ul> <li>Do not answer your door at your hotel/residence unless you know who it is.  </li> <li>Do not physically resist any robbery attempt.  </li> <li>Enroll in the <a href="https://step.state.gov/">Smart Traveler Enrollment Program (STEP)</a>&nbsp;to receive Alerts and make it easier to locate you in an emergency.  </li> <li>Follow the Department of State on <a href="https://gcc02.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Ftravelgov&amp;data=05%7C01%7COCSContentManager%40state.gov%7C7cedeb739c6c479b839908da498208a5%7C66cf50745afe48d1a691a12b2121f44b%7C0%7C0%7C637903120072995855%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C3000%7C%7C%7C&amp;sdata=IW5Jm7DGLxPETBebgEA40AqaoeLkbFY4tbZsrUdTnSM%3D&amp;reserved=0">Facebook</a>, <a href="https://gcc02.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.twitter.com%2Ftravelgov&amp;data=05%7C01%7COCSContentManager%40state.gov%7C7cedeb739c6c479b839908da498208a5%7C66cf50745afe48d1a691a12b2121f44b%7C0%7C0%7C637903120072995855%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C3000%7C%7C%7C&amp;sdata=fTU5nWQ1HJhX91tQdhQwu7Vx8dD6y2HnIRkr%2FhX9Wgo%3D&amp;reserved=0">Twitter</a>, and <a href="https://www.instagram.com/travelgov/" adhocenable="false">Instagram</a>.  </li> <li>Review the <a href="https://gcc02.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.osac.gov%2FContent%2FBrowse%2FReport%3FsubContentTypes%3DCountry%2520Security%2520Report&amp;data=05%7C01%7COCSContentManager%40state.gov%7C7cedeb739c6c479b839908da498208a5%7C66cf50745afe48d1a691a12b2121f44b%7C0%7C0%7C637903120072995855%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C3000%7C%7C%7C&amp;sdata=EGbpoF23LpXvIaakXxXonOgHvVEINpzL1R2v6lw%2B2eg%3D&amp;reserved=0">Country Security Report</a>&nbsp;for The Bahamas.  </li> <li>Prepare&nbsp;a contingency plan for emergency and medical situations.  Review the <a href="https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/travelers-checklist.html">Traveler’s Checklist</a>.  </li> <li>Visit the CDC page for the latest <a href="https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/destinations/list">Travel Health Information</a> related to your travel.</li> </ul> </summary>

Exercise increased caution in Nicaragua due to&nbsp;<b>crime.</b></p> <p><b>Country Summary</b>: Throughout Nicaragua, government and law enforcement officials continue to target individuals and organizations seen as opponents of President Daniel Ortega and his wife, Vice President Rosario Murillo. U.S. citizens, including dual Nicaraguan-U.S. citizens, have been subject to revocation of Nicaraguan citizenship, reentry bans, expulsion,<b> </b>and other actions. The government and its affiliated groups have been reported to:</p> <ul> <li>Arbitrarily prevent individuals from entering or departing Nicaragua by air or land for perceived associations.</li> <li>Search personal phones, computers, and documents for anti-government content, limit photography of government property, and sometimes seize devices.</li> <li>Systematically target individuals for political reasons, regardless of nationality, including former allies, political activists, business representatives, clergy, human rights advocates, civil society leaders, academics, and members of the press.</li> <li>Arbitrarily target pro-democracy advocates and their family members.</li> <li>Confiscate privately-owned land, residences, financial assets, and personal property without warning or due process.</li> <li>Arbitrarily detain, accuse, and charge individuals with terrorism, money laundering, and organized crime offenses for political reasons without respect for fair trial guarantees.</li> </ul> <p>U.S. citizen residents of Nicaragua also report increased scrutiny of alleged political speech.</p> <p>U.S. citizens arrested in Nicaragua may find themselves subject to prolonged detention without charges or respect of fair trial guarantees.

<summary type="html"><p><b><i>Reissued with obsolete COVID-19 page links removed.</i></b></p> <p><b>Do not travel to Belarus due to the Belarusian authorities’ continued facilitation of Russia’s war against Ukraine, the buildup of Russian military forces in Belarus, the arbitrary enforcement of local laws, the potential of civil unrest, the risk of detention,&nbsp;and&nbsp;the Embassy’s limited ability to assist U.S. citizens residing in or traveling to Belarus. U.S. citizens in Belarus should depart immediately.</b></p> <p>On February 28, 2022, the Department of State ordered the departure of U.S. government employees and the suspension of operations of the U.S. Embassy in Minsk. <b>All consular services, routine and emergency, are suspended until further notice.</b>&nbsp;U.S. citizens in Belarus who require consular services should try to leave the country as soon as possible and contact a U.S. embassy or consulate in another country.</p> <p>Due to Belarusian authorities’ continued facilitation of Russia’s unprovoked attack on Ukraine and given the heightened volatility and unpredictable nature of the regional security environment, <b>do not travel to Belarus.&nbsp;</b>Potential harassment targeted specifically at foreigners is also possible.&nbsp;</p> <p>Exercise increased awareness and vigilance regarding political and military tensions in the region.&nbsp;<b>U.S. citizens are advised to avoid public demonstrations.</b>&nbsp;Authorities have used force to disperse demonstrators, including those peacefully demonstrating.

U.S. citizens in the vicinity of demonstrations have been arrested. Some have been victims of harassment and/or mistreatment by Belarusian officials. Belarusian authorities have targeted individuals associated with independent and foreign media.

<summary type="html"><p><b><i>Reissued with obsolete COVID-19 page links removed.</i></b></p> <p>Do not travel to South Sudan due to <b>crime, kidnapping, </b>and <b>armed conflict.</b></p> <p><b>Country Summary</b>: Violent crime, such as carjackings, shootings, ambushes, assaults, robberies, and kidnappings is common throughout South Sudan, including Juba. Foreign nationals have been the victims of rape, sexual assault, armed robberies, and other violent crimes.</p> <p>Armed conflict is ongoing and includes fighting between various political and ethnic groups. Weapons are readily available to the population. In addition, cattle raids occur throughout the country and often lead to violence.</p> <p>Reporting in South Sudan without the proper documentation from the South Sudanese Media Authority is considered illegal, and any journalistic work there is very dangerous. Journalists regularly report being harassed in South Sudan, and many have been killed while covering the conflict.</p> <p>The U.S. government has limited ability to provide emergency consular services to U.S. citizens in South Sudan. U.S. government personnel in South Sudan are under a strict curfew. They must use armored vehicles for nearly all movements, and official travel outside Juba is limited. Due to the critical crime threat in Juba, walking is also restricted; when allowed, it is limited to a small area in the immediate vicinity of the Embassy and during daylight hours only. Family members cannot accompany U.S. government employees who work in South Sudan.</p> <p>Due to risks to civil aviation operating within or in the vicinity of South Sudan, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has issued a Notice to Air Missions (NOTAM) and/or a Special Federal Aviation Regulation (SFAR). For more information U.S. citizens should consult the <a href="https://www.faa.gov/air_traffic/publications/us_restrictions/">Federal Aviation Administration’s Prohibitions, Restrictions, and Notices</a>.</p> <p>Read the <a href="https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/International-Travel-Country-Information-Pages/SouthSudan.html">country information page</a> for additional information on travel to South Sudan.</p> <p>If you decide to travel to South Sudan:</p> <ul> <li>Exercise extreme care in all parts of the country, including Juba. Travel outside of Juba with a minimum of two vehicles along with appropriate recovery and medical equipment in case of mechanical failure or other emergency.</li> <li>Avoid travel along border areas.</li> <li>Avoid demonstrations and public gatherings.

<summary type="html"><p><b>Reissued with obsolete COVID-19 page links removed.</b></p> <p>Reconsider travel to El Salvador due to&nbsp;<b>crime.</b></p> <p><b>Country Summary:&nbsp;</b>In March 2022, the Government of El Salvador (GOES) declared a “State of Exception” in response to an increase in homicides. The declaration remains in effect. The State of Exception grants authorities power to arrest anyone suspected of gang activity and suspends several constitutional rights, including the normal protections of criminal procedure such as the right to a speedy trial. Prison conditions are harsh. Several U.S. and other foreign citizens have been detained under the State of Exception, some in a reportedly arbitrary manner. Under its Territorial Control Plan, the GOES also may, without prior warning, restrict access via checkpoints to areas suspected of gang activity. U.S. citizens are advised that access to and freedom of movement within these areas may be limited.</p> <p>Though there has been a significant reduction in gang-related activity, violent crime remains a concern throughout significant portions of the country. Crime rates vary among departamentos (states) and municipios (municipalities), and areas witnessing higher crime rates are often located in close proximity to lower crime areas or must be crossed in moving between lower risk areas. Local authorities may lack the resources to respond effectively to serious criminal incidents, although the concentration of resources in resort areas means these areas tend to be better policed than urban areas.</p> <p>Read the&nbsp;<a href="https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/International-Travel-Country-Information-Pages/ElSalvador.html">country information page</a>&nbsp;for additional information on travel to El Salvador.</p> <p>If you decide to travel to El Salvador:&nbsp;</p> <ul> <li>Be aware of your surroundings.</li> <li>Do not walk outside after dark.

<summary type="html"><p><b>Do not travel to Ukraine due to Russia’s war against Ukraine.</b> The Department of State continues to advise that U.S. citizens not travel to Ukraine due to active armed conflict. Read the entire Travel Advisory.</p> <p>All U.S. citizens should carefully monitor U.S. government notices and local and international media outlets for information about changing security conditions and alerts to shelter in place. Those choosing to remain in Ukraine should exercise caution due to the potential for military attacks, crime, civil unrest, and consult the Department’s latest security alerts.</p> <p>The security situation in Ukraine remains unpredictable. U.S. citizens in Ukraine should stay vigilant and take appropriate steps to increase their security awareness. Know the location of your closest shelter or protected space. In the event of mortar, missile, drone, or rocket fire, follow instructions from local authorities and seek shelter immediately. If you feel your current location is no longer safe, you should carefully assess the potential risks involved in moving to a different location.</p> <p>There are continued reports of Russian forces and their proxies singling out U.S. citizens in Russian-occupied areas of Ukraine for detention, interrogation, or harassment because of their nationality. U.S. citizens have also been singled out when evacuating by land through Russia-occupied territory or to Russia or Belarus.</p> <p>U.S. citizens seeking emergency assistance should email <a href="mailto:KyivACS@state.gov">KyivACS@state.gov</a> for assistance. Please review <a href="https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/emergencies/what-state-dept-can-cant-do-crisis.html">what the U.S. government can and cannot do to assist you in a crisis overseas</a>. U.S. citizens may also seek consular services, including requests for repatriation loans, passports, and visa services, at <a href="https://www.usembassy.gov/">U.S. embassies and consulates in neighboring countries</a>.</p> <p>On February 24, 2022, the Ukrainian government declared a state of emergency. Each province (oblast) decides on measures to be implemented according to local conditions. Measures could include curfews, restrictions on the freedom of movement, ID verification, and increased security inspections, among other measures. Follow any oblast-specific state of emergency measures.</p> <p>Many in the international community, including the United States and Ukraine, do not recognize Russia’s purported annexation of Crimea in 2014, nor the September 2022 purported annexation of four other Ukrainian oblasts -- Donetsk, Luhansk, Kherson, and Zaporizhzhia. There is extensive Russian Federation military presence in these areas. There are also abuses against foreigners and the local population by the occupation authorities in these regions, particularly against those who are seen as challenging Russia’s occupation.</p> <p>Although Russia’s ongoing war against Ukraine severely restricts the Embassy’s access and ability to provide services in these areas, the Department of State and the U.S. Embassy in Kyiv continue to remotely provide certain emergency consular services to U.S. citizens in Crimea as well as four other Ukrainian oblasts partially occupied by Russia – Donetsk, Luhansk, Kherson, and Zaporizhzhia – to the extent possible given security conditions.</p> <p>The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has issued a Notice to Air Missions (NOTAM) prohibiting U.S. aviation operations into, out of, within, or over Ukraine. For more information, U.S. citizens should consult the FAA’s <a href="https://www.faa.gov/air_traffic/publications/us_restrictions">Prohibitions, Restrictions, and Notices</a>.</p> <p>Read the <a href="https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/International-Travel-Country-Information-Pages/Ukraine.html">country information page</a> for additional information on travel to Ukraine.</p> <p><b>Travel to High-Risk Areas</b></p> <p>If you choose to disregard the Travel Advisory and travel to Ukraine, you should consider taking the following steps:</p> <ul> <li> Visit our website on <a href="https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/travelers-with-special-considerations/high-risk-travelers.html">Travel to High-Risk areas</a>.</li> <li>Draft a will and designate appropriate insurance beneficiaries and/or power of attorney.</li> <li>Discuss a plan with loved ones regarding care/custody of children, pets, property, belongings, non-liquid assets (collections, artwork, etc.), funeral wishes, etc.</li> <li>Share important documents, login information, and points of contact with loved ones so that they can manage your affairs if you are unable to return as planned to the United States.</li> <li>Leave DNA samples with your medical provider in case it is necessary for your family to access them.</li> <li>Establish your own personal security plan in coordination with your employer or host&nbsp;organization or&nbsp;consider consulting with a professional security organization.</li> <li>Develop a communication plan with family and/or your employer or host organization so that they can monitor your safety and location as you travel through high-risk areas.
